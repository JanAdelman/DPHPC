# DPHPC

In this project we will implement a parallelised suffix array building algorithm for fast string search (FSS). Our practical intentions are fast genome indexing. 

Inspiration is drawn from the following papers:

Our project consists of the following steps:

- Implement suffix array building algorithm
- We will use MPI to coordinate across multiple working nodes

## Compilation

The build environment with MPICH and google-benchmark can be built using the contained Dockerfile. 

* Compile:
```
mpicxx -O3 -pg  -std=c++11 main_mpi.cpp -o main
```

* GPROF Anyalysis
```
gprof ./main  gmon.out
```

* Euler 
```
bsub -n 128 -R "rusage[mem=amount_of_mem_you_need (bytes)]" mpirun  ./main
```
